# Android Malware Detection with Graph Reduction, Contrastive Learning, and LLM Embeddings

This project focuses on utilizing advanced techniques such as graph reduction, contrastive learning, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to enhance the detection of malware in Android applications. By leveraging these cutting-edge methods, the system is designed to provide robust and accurate detection mechanisms for malicious behaviors within Android environments.

## Features

1. **Graph-Based Representation:**
   - Represent Android application behaviors using directed graphs derived from system calls, API invocations, and other relevant runtime data.
   - Perform graph reduction to simplify the structure while retaining meaningful patterns.

2. **Contrastive Learning:**
   - Apply contrastive learning to learn discriminative features between malicious and benign samples.
   - Use embeddings from graph structures to identify unique patterns specific to malware.

3. **LLM Embeddings:**
   - Integrate embeddings generated by large language models to capture semantic information from code or logs.
   - Combine static code analysis with dynamic behavior insights for comprehensive detection.

4. **Pipeline Integration:**
   - End-to-end pipeline for preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and inference.
   - Modular design for extensibility and easy integration into existing systems.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components:

1. **Graph Reduction:**
   - Extract graphs from Android applications representing control-flow, data-flow, or dependency relationships.
   - Simplify graphs by removing redundant nodes/edges while preserving critical structures.

2. **Contrastive Learning Module:**
   - Train models using contrastive loss to maximize the similarity between embeddings of similar classes (benign/malware) and minimize similarity for dissimilar classes.
   - Enhance generalization for unseen malware samples.

3. **LLM Embedding Integration:**
   - Utilize pre-trained LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models or similar) to extract embeddings from decompiled code or logs.
   - Combine these embeddings with graph-based features for richer representation.

4. **Detection Model:**
   - Classifier that integrates graph-based features and LLM embeddings to detect malicious activities.
   - Flexible backend supporting various architectures (e.g., GNNs, transformers).

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Obtain a dataset of Android APK files (e.g., Drebin, AndroZoo).
2. Extract static and dynamic features:
   - Static analysis: Use decompilation tools (e.g., JADX) for code extraction.
   - Dynamic analysis: Simulate apps in a sandbox to gather runtime data.

3. Convert features into graph representations and embeddings.

### Training the Model

Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir <path_to_data> --output_dir <path_to_output>
```

### Testing the Model

Run the inference script:
```bash
python test.py --model_path <path_to_model> --test_dir <path_to_test_data>
```
